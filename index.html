C. Payments (if in-app purchases are enabled)
Purchases are processed by the app store platform (e.g., Google Play). We do not collect or store your full payment card details. We may receive purchase-related information such as purchase status and transaction identifiers for customer support and fraud prevention.

3) How We Use Information
We use information for the following purposes:
- Provide and operate the App (including saving settings, enabling features, and delivering content).
- Improve the App (analytics, debugging, crash investigation, performance optimization, and new feature development).
- Customer support (responding to requests and troubleshooting).
- Security and integrity (preventing fraud, enforcing policies, protecting users, and maintaining service stability).
- Legal compliance (meeting applicable legal obligations and responding to lawful requests).

4) Legal Basis (if applicable)
Where required by law, we process information based on one or more of the following: your consent, performance of a contract (providing the App), legitimate interests (service improvement and security), and/or legal obligations.

5) Sharing and Disclosure
We do not sell your personal information.

We may share information in these cases:
A. Service providers (processors)
We may share information with vendors that help us operate the App (e.g., cloud hosting, analytics, crash reporting, customer support tools). These providers are permitted to process information only to provide services to us under contractual obligations.

B. Legal and safety
We may disclose information if required by law or if we believe disclosure is necessary to protect rights, safety, and security, or to investigate fraud and abuse.

C. Business transfers
If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, restructuring, or asset sale, information may be transferred as part of that transaction, subject to applicable legal requirements.

6) International Data Transfers (if applicable)
If information is processed outside your country, we take steps to protect it in accordance with applicable law (e.g., contractual protections and security measures).

7) Data Retention
We retain information only as long as necessary for the purposes described in this policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.
